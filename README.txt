Ensure an easy login experience for your users by enabling single sign-in via Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google on your WordPress website

== Description ==

The social login for WordPress plugin allows you to enable a single sign-on on your WordPress/WooCommerce site using the existing information from a social networking service such as Facebook, Google, or LinkedIn.

It helps your users to quickly login to your website instead of creating a new login account specifically for the website. It is designed to simplify logins for end users as well as provide more and more reliable demographic information to web developers.

== Key Features of a Social Login Plugin ==

* Single click user registration and login via Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn.
* Let users’ sync their social profiles with their WordPress account.
* Enable social login on the WooCommerce login page, registration page, and checkout page.
* Define a custom redirect URL with any of the enabled social media accounts.
* Easy setup
* GDPR Compliance
* Tested OK with WooCommerce 5.8.0

== Why Social Login? ==

Logging in has become an inevitable action to enter a website owing to the privacy of users data. Thus the more websites you visit the more accounts and login credentials will be created thereby making it difficult for the user to remember these credentials accurately to avail the respective services.

Getting access to a website without entering a username password combination has definitely made social login one of the best and the most popular authentication methods over other traditional login options which ultimately forces every website owner out there to employ social login on their websites for accessing it.

== How Social login Benefits WordPress Sites ==

The growth of WordPress from a mere blogging platform to the building block of many major eCommerce websites with huge traffic has increased the need of having a proper login option that is both easy and secure for its users. Social login fits the criteria with utmost accuracy. If you own a website with WordPress, you can add a social login option to it using the Social login for WordPress plugin.

Here is how social login benefits your WordPress sites and WooCommerce stores’ growth.

* Easy login or Registration- Social login enables easy login compared to other login options as it doesn't require a different account to be created in order to log in to different websites.
* Heavy Traffic - Since social login enables easy social sharing users will be able to share things they liked and bought to their friends over social media thereby bringing heavy traffic to the website.
* Increased sales - It is seen that people share a vast amount of personal data including their location, interests, hobbies, purchasing habits —as well as those of everyone in his or her social network through social media. This data can be used as a strong business tool to increase sales by bringing to users their favorite product or services on your website so that it will be hard for customers to not make a purchase.
* Increase in genuine feedback- When users' comments are tied to their social media accounts it is less likely to receive false or misleading comments on your website's product or services since they have their personal identity at stake.
* Less privacy risk for users - The privacy risk of having the same password for all websites (since users replicate the password of one account to the rest of the accounts in order to avoid creating a new password) will definitely lower with the use of social login.

Make sure that the “App ID/API Key” and “App Secret” keys are the same in both plugin settings and social application configuration.
For Facebook, you can copy its App ID & App secret values to the Facebook App ID/API Key and Facebook App Secret fields, and for Google and LinkedIn as well, you can copy each of its “Client ID” & “Client Secret” values to the corresponding App ID/API key and App secret fields in the plugin. 
Another thing to note is that if you’re using “/” at the end of the Redirect URLs you must add that URL to the app settings of Redirect URIs. Example:- https://www.example.com/wp-login.php/ if you’re using this URL in the redirect URL you must set that to app settings.
